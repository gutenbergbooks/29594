<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<h3>BELLIGERENT POWERS.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Tuesday</span> morning dawned "as clear
as a bell," as an old lady once said,
and the Dashahed Zouaves, if not
exactly up with the sun, were awake
and stirring at a much earlier hour
than usual; and after a rather more
careful washing and brushing than
soldiers usually indulge in, assembled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
on the lawn, looking as bright as their
own buttons.</p>

<p>"What fun it is to be soldiers!"
cried a little lisping fellow, one of the
privates. "I only wish thome Southerners
would come along now, and
you'd thee how I'd <i>thmash</i> 'em."</p>

<p>"Bravo, Louie!" said Harry,
laughing; "I dare say, if we were to
go to the wars, you'd keep on fighting
the battles of your country till you
were chopped into inch bits!"</p>

<p>"And pickled! I expect to be
made Lieutenant-general, Commander-in-chief,
Colonel, Major, Captain,
Lieutenant, Sergeant Hamilton at the
very least!"</p>

<p>"Pooh! that's nothing to the feats
of bravery I intend to perform!" cried<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
Peter. "In my first battle I shall
capture a 2,000-pound columbiad with
one hand tied behind me, and carry
it home for a paper weight!"</p>

<p>"While I'm charging a regiment
of mounted infantry single handed,
and making them throw away their
swords, and pistols, and things, and
run for that 'last ditch' of theirs
double quick!" said Will Costar,
laughing; "but here comes breakfast,
I'm happy to say. It strikes me
camping out makes a fellow awful
hungry, as well as no end of brave."</p>

<p>A servant who had been sent from
the house with breakfast materials,
now approached, and the table being
laid, the soldiers drew their camp
stools around it; Colonel Freddy sitting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
at the head and pouring out coffee
with great gravity. Everything
was going on smoothly enough, when
Harry tilted the tray on one side, and
Charley knocked his elbow on the
other, and away went the coffee to
the very end of the table!</p>

<p>"Charley," exclaimed the Colonel,
severely, "what do you mean, sir?
I'll have you put in arrest if you don't
look out!"</p>

<p>"Who'll put me there?"</p>

<p>"Me!" shouted Peter. "I'm the
boy to manage refractories. You'll
see how I will come after you with a
sharp stick&mdash;bayonet, I mean&mdash;and
put you in arrest like that!" snapping
his fingers.</p>

<p>"By the way, when we've caught<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
our rebels, where is the prison to be?"
asked Jimmy.</p>

<p>"Why, in the smoke house. There's
a patent spring bolt on the door&mdash;father
had it fixed the last time we
had hams made; and if anybody was
once in there, they'd never get out in
the world, unless they could draw
themselves fine like a wire and squeeze
through the chimney."</p>

<p>"We'll take care to keep out of it,
then!" said Charley; "so, Colonel,
I beg pardon for tilting the biggin&mdash;I
didn't mean to do it so much&mdash;really!"</p>

<p>"I, too!" cried Harry; "shake
hands, old chap!"</p>

<p>Good-tempered Freddy, always
ready to "make up," caught a hand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
of each of his comrades, and breakfast
went on amicably.</p>

<p>Now, there lived in the house an
old English man servant named Jerry
Pike. He had formerly been a groom
and attendant on Peter's uncle, Major
Schermerhorn, and volunteered in the
army at the time of the war with
Mexico, that he might follow his dear
master, whom he had served and loved
ever since the Major was a mere boy.
He had fought bravely beside him in
many a hard battle, and, for his gallant
conduct, been promoted to the
rank of sergeant. When the hand of
death removed that kind master, Mr.
Schermerhorn had gladly taken Jerry
to his own house, and promised him
that should be his home as long as he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
lived. So now, like a gallant old war
horse, who has a fresh green paddock,
and lives in clover in his infirm age,
Jerry not only stood at ease, but lived
at ease; and worked or not as he felt
disposed.</p>

<p>When breakfast was over, Peter
suddenly cried out, "I say, fellows, suppose
we employ ourselves by having a
drill! You know old Jerry that I
told you about? I'll ask him to give
us a lesson!"</p>

<p>"Yes! that will be grand fun!"
said Freddy. "Do go and find him,
Peter; I should really like to learn
how to drill as the soldiers do; so
when General McClellan comes along,
he'll admire us as much as the English
General, old Sir Goutby Slogo, did the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Seventh Regiment when they paraded
before the Prince. 'Really, most extraordinary
style of marching these
American troops have,' said he, 'most
hequal to the 'Orse Guards and the
Hoxford Blues coming down Regent
street!'"</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Peter had scampered
off to the house, and in a short time
returned with a comical-looking little
old man, dressed in faded regimentals.</p>

<p>He touched his cap to the boys as
he approached, in military style, and
then drew himself up so very stiff and
straight, awaiting their orders, that,
as Freddy whispered to Tom, it was a
perfect wonder he didn't snap short
off at the waist.</p>

<p>"Now, Jerry," began the Colonel,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
"we want you to give us a <i>real</i> drill,
you know, just as you used to learn."</p>

<p>"Yes, a regular one!" chimed in
the rest; "we'll run for our guns."</p>

<p>"Not fur your fust drill, I reckon,
genl'men. You'll do bad enough without
'em, hech, hech!" cackled Jerry.</p>

<p>"Very well&mdash;come begin then,
Jerry!" cried impatient Will.</p>

<p>"Are ye all ready?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and waiting."</p>

<p>"Then, genl'men, <span class="smcap">Fall in</span>!" exclaimed
the sergeant, the first two
words being uttered in his natural
voice, but the last in an awful sepulchral
tone, like two raps on the base
kettle drum. Off duty, Jerry rather
resembled a toy soldier, but when in
giving his orders he stiffened his body,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
threw up his head, and stuck out his
hands, he looked so like the wooden
figures out of Noah's ark, that the
boys burst into a shout of laughter.</p>

<p>"Now, genl'men," exclaimed Jerry
in a severe tone, "this won't do. Silence
in the ranks. Squad! 'Shun.
The fust manoover I shel teach you,
genl'men, is the manoover of 'parade
rest.' Now look at me, and do as I
do."</p>

<p>Anybody would have supposed,
naturally enough, that to stand at rest
meant to put your hands in your pockets
and lean against a tree; but what
Jerry did, was to slap his right hand
against his left, like a torpedo going
off, and fold them together; stick out
his left foot, lean heavily upon his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
right, and look more like a Dutch doll
than ever.</p>

<p>The boys accordingly endeavored
to imitate this performance; but when
they came to try it, a difficulty arose.
Whatever might be their usual ideas
on the subject, there was a diversity
of opinion now as to the proper foot to
be advanced, and a wild uncertainty
which was the left foot. The new soldiers
shuffled backward and forward
as if they were dancing hornpipes;
while Jerry shouted, "Now, then,
genl'men, I can't hear them hands
come together smartly as I'd wished,
not like a row of Jarsey cider bottles
a poppin' one arter the other, but
all at once. Now, then, SQUAD!
'SHUN!" in a voice of thunder,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
"Stan' at parade rest! No&mdash;no&mdash;them
<i>lef futs</i> adwanced! Well if
ever!" And Jerry in his indignation
gave himself such a thump on his
chest that he knocked all the breath
out of his body, and had to wait some
moments before he could go on; while
the boys, bubbling over with fun, took
his scoldings in high good humor, and
shrieked with laughter at their own
ridiculous blunders, to the high wrath
of their ancient instructor; who was
so deeply interested and in earnest
about his pursuit, that he didn't fail
to lecture them well for their "insubornation;"
which, indeed, nobody
minded, except Tom Pringle, who, by
the by, was from Maryland, and
many of whose relations were down<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
South. He had been looking rather
sulky from the beginning of the drill,
and now suddenly stepped from his
place in the ranks, exclaiming, "I
won't play! now I vow I won't!"</p>

<p>"Why, Tom, what is the matter?
Are you mad at us?" cried half a
dozen voices at once.</p>

<p>"Humm&mdash;" grumbled sulky Tom.</p>

<p>"What say? I can't hear you,"
said Freddy. "Nonsense, Tom, don't
be poky, come back and drill."</p>

<p>"I won't! Let us alone, will
you?"</p>

<p>"All we want is, let us alone!"
chanted Peter. "There, Fred, let him
be cross if he wants to, we can play
without him;" and the boys ran back
to their places in the ranks, Freddy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
calling out, "Come fellows, let's try
that old parade rest once more;" and
on Jerry's giving the command, they
really <i>did</i> do it this time, and were
pronounced capable of passing to
grander evolutions.</p>

<p>The first of these was the turn
about so as to fall in ranks; something
the Dashahed Zouaves hadn't
dreamt of before. Get into ranks?
Nothing could be easier than to stand
four in a row, as they had done before;
but when it came to "right
face," most of the soldiers were found
to have opposite views on the subject,
and faced each other, to their mutual
astonishment. The natural consequence
was, that in three seconds the
regiment was in such a snarl and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
huddle, that no one could tell which
rank he belonged to or anything else;
so Jerry, perfectly purple in the face
with shouting, by way of helping them
out of the scrape, gave them the following
remarkable advice: "Squad,
'shun! At th' wud 'Foz' the rer-rank
will stepsmartly off wi' th' leffut,
tekkinapesstoth' rare&mdash;Fo-o-o-res!"</p>

<p>"W-h-a-t!" was the unanimous
exclamation.</p>

<p>Jerry repeated his mandate, which,
after infinite puzzling (the honest sergeant
being no assistance whatever),
was discovered to mean, "At the
word 'Fours,' the rear rank will step
smartly off with the left foot, taking a
pace to the rear. Fours!"</p>

<p>This difficulty solved, the next<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
"article on the programme," as Peter
said, was the command March! or
"harch!" according to Jerry.</p>

<p>Out stepped Freddy, confident that
he knew this much at any rate, followed
by the others; but here again
that celebrated left foot got them into
trouble. The right foot <i>would</i> pop out
here and there, and as sure as it did,
at the third step the unlucky Zouave
found his leg firmly stuck between the
ankles of the boy in front; and the
"man" behind him treading on his
heels in a way calculated to aggravate
a saint; while meantime, the fellows
in the rear rank, who were forever
falling behind while they were staring
at their feet to make sure which was
the left one, <i>would</i> endeavor to make<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
up for it by taking a wide straddling
step all of a sudden, and encircled the
legs of people in front; a proceeding
which, not being in accordance with
"Hardee's Tactics," was not received
with approbation by Jerry; who,
looking at them with a sort of deprecating
pity, hoarsely said, "Now,
Company D! wot&mdash;wrong agin?
fowod squad! wun, too, three, foore;
hup! hup! hup! hold your head up,
Mr. Fred; turn out your toes, Master
William, and keep <span class="smcap">steady</span>!"</p>

<p>"Goody!" exclaimed Freddy at
last, stopping short in the middle of
his marching, "I can't stand this any
longer! There, Jerry, we've had drill
enough, thank you; I am knocked
into a cocked hat, for my part!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>"Very well, sir; it <i>is</i> powerful
hot; an' I must say you young genl'men
have kep' at it steadier nor I expected,
a gred deal."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Jerry," said George,
laughing, "we shall not forget our
first drill in a hurry. I can't tell, for
my part, which has been most bothered,
you or we."</p>

<p>"Allers glad to give you a little
practice," grinned Jerry, "though
you'd rive the gizzard out of an army
drill sergeant, I'd wenture to say, if
he hed the teachin' of you. Hech!
hech! hech! Mornin', genl'men,
your sarvent," and Jerry touched his
cap to Colonel Freddy and marched
off chuckling.</p>

<p>As soon as he had made his exit,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
the boys clustered around Tom, as he
sat turning his back on as many of the
company as possible, and all began in
a breath, "Now, Tom, do tell us what
you're mad at; what have we done?
please speak!"</p>

<p>"Well, then," shouted Tom, springing
up, "I'll tell you what, Frederic
Jourdain! I won't be ordered around
by any old monkey like that,"&mdash;pointing
toward Jerry&mdash;"and as for <i>you</i>
and <i>your</i> ordering about, I won't stand
that either! fine as you think yourself;
the Colonel, indeed!"</p>

<p>"Why, Tom, how can you talk
so? can't you play like the rest of us?
I'm sure I haven't taken advantage
of being Colonel to be domineering;
have I, boys?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, no! not a bit, Fred&mdash;never
mind what he says!"</p>

<p>"Oh <i>do</i>&mdash;<i>don't</i> appeal to them!
You do that because you daren't say
outright you mean to have everything
your own way. That may be very
well for them&mdash;you're all a parcel of
Yankee shopkeepers together&mdash;but, I
can tell you, no Southern <i>gentleman</i>
will stand it!"</p>

<p>"North or South, Tom," began
Will Costar, pretty sharply, "every
regiment must have a head&mdash;and obey
the head. We've chosen Fred our
Colonel, and you must mind him.
When he tells you to drill you've <i>got
to do it!</i>"</p>

<p>Tom wheeled round perfectly furious.
"You say that again," he shouted,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
"and I'll leave the regiment! I
will. I won't be told by any Northerner
that I'm his subordinate, and
if my State hadn't thought so too,
she'd never have left the Union."</p>

<p>"What! you dare to say anything
against the Union!" cried George,
turning white with rage; "do you
mean to say that you <i>admire</i> the
South for seceding?"</p>

<p>"Yes! I've a great mind to secede
myself, what's more!"</p>

<p>Freddy, as I said, was as sweet-tempered
a little fellow as ever lived;
but he was fairly aroused now. His
blue eyes flashed fire; he crimsoned to
the temples; his fists were clenched&mdash;and
shouting, "you traitor!" like a
flash, he sent Tom flying over on his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
back, with the camp stool about his
ears.</p>

<p>Up jumped Tom, kicked away the
stool, and rushed toward Fred. But
the others were too quick for him;
they seized his arms and dragged him
back; Peter calling out "No, don't
fight him, Colonel; he's not worth it;
let's have a court martial&mdash;that's the
way to serve traitors!"</p>

<p>Amid a perfect uproar of rage and
contempt for this shameful attack on
their Colonel, the Zouaves hastily arranged
some camp stools for judge and
jury; and George being chosen judge,
the oldest members of the regiment
took their places around him, and
Tom was hauled up before the Court.</p>

<p>"Oh stop, pray stop!" cried Freddy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
at this stage of affairs. "Indeed, I
forgive him for what he said to me, if
he will take back his language about
the Union. I can't stand <i>that</i>."</p>

<p>"You hear what the Colonel says,"
said George, sternly; "will you retract?"</p>

<p>"No, never! if you think I'm going
to be frightened into submission
to a Northerner you're very much
mistaken! No Southerner will ever
be that! and as for your precious
Union, I don't care if I say I hope
there never will be a Union any more."</p>

<p>"Then, by George!" shouted the
judge, fairly springing from his seat,
"You're a traitor, sir! Fellows, whoever
is in favor of having this secessionist
put under arrest, say Aye!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>"Aye! <span class="smcap">aye</span>! AYE!" in a perfect
roar.</p>

<p>"Does any one object?" Nobody
spoke.</p>

<p>"Then I sentence him to be confined
in the guard house till he begs
pardon; Livingston, Costar, and Boorman
to take him there."</p>

<p>His captors pounced upon their
prisoner with very little ceremony
when this sentence was pronounced;
when Tom, without attempting to
escape, suddenly commenced striking
out at every one he could reach. A
grand hurley-burley ensued; but before
long Tom was overpowered and
dragged to the smoke, <i>alias</i> guard
house; heaping insults and taunts on
the Union and the regiment all the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
way. Harry flung open the door of
the prison, a picturesque little hut
built of rough gray stone, and covered
with Virginia creepers and wild honeysuckles.
The others pushed Tom in,
and Peter, dashing forward, slammed
the door on him with a bang. Snap!
went the bolt, and now nothing earthly
could open it again but a Bramah
key or a gunpowder explosion.
Young Secession was fast, and the
North triumphant. Hurrah!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3>BULL RUN.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Their</span> first excitement over, the
gallant Zouaves couldn't help looking
at each other in rather a comical way.
To be sure, it was very aggravating to
have their country run down, and
themselves assailed without leave or
license; but they were by no means
certain, now they came to think of it,
that they had acted rightly in doing
justice to the little rebel in such a
summary manner. Peter especially,
who had proposed the court martial,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
had an instinctive feeling that if his
father were to learn the action they
had taken, he would scarcely consider
it to tally with the exercise of strict
politeness to company. In short, without
a word said, there was a tacit
understanding in the corps that this
was an affair to be kept profoundly
secret.</p>

<p>While they were still silently revolving
this delicate question, little
Louie Hamilton suddenly started violently,
exclaiming, "Only listen a moment,
felloth! what a strange noithe!
It sounds like thome wild beast!"</p>

<p>"Noise? I don't hear any," said
Freddy; "yes I do, though&mdash;like
something trampling the bushes!"</p>

<p>"There's nothing worse than four<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
cows and a house dog about our
place," said Peter; "but what that is
I don't know&mdash;hush!"</p>

<p>The boys listened with all their
ears and elbows, and nearly stared
themselves blind looking around to see
what was the matter. They had not
long to wait, however, for the trampling
increased in the wood, a curious,
low growling was heard, which presently
swelled to a roar, and in a moment
more, an immense brindled bull
was seen dashing through the locusts,
his head down and heels in the
air, looking not unlike a great wheel-barrow,
bellowing at a prodigious
rate, and making straight toward the
place where they stood!</p>

<p>"Murder, what <i>shall</i> we do?" cried<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Louie, turning deadly pale with terror,
while the Zouaves, for an instant,
appeared perfectly paralyzed.</p>

<p>"Why run! run for your lives!"
shouted George, who was the first to
recover himself. "Peter, you lead the
way; take us the shortest cut to the
house, and&mdash;oh!"</p>

<p>Not another word did George utter.
He was saving his breath for the
race. And now, indeed, began a most
prodigious "skedaddle;" the boys almost
flying on ahead, running nearly
abreast, and their terrible enemy close
behind, tearing up the ground with
his horns, and galloping like an express!</p>

<p>On sped the gallant Zouaves, making
off as rapidly from the scene of action<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
as their namesakes from Manassas,
without pausing to remark which
way the wind blew, until, at last, they
had skirted the grove, and were on
the straight road for the house. Here
Peter stopped a moment, "Because
some of the men will be near here,
perhaps," he pantingly said, "and
Master Bull will be caught if he ventures
after us." Scarcely had he
spoken, when the furious animal was
once more seen, dashing on faster than
ever, and flaming with rage, till he
might have exploded a powder mill!
Now for a last effort! One determined
burst over the smooth road,
and they are safe in the house!</p>

<p>Little Louie, who was only nine
years old, and the youngest of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
party, had grasped hold of Freddy's
hand when they first started; and
been half pulled along by him so far;
but now that safety was close at hand,
he suddenly sank to the ground,
moaning out, "Oh Fred, you must go
on and leave me; I can't run any
more. Oh mamma!"</p>

<p>"No, no, Louie! don't do so!" cried
Freddy. "Get up, little man! why,
you can't think I would leave you,
surely?" and, stooping down, the
brave little fellow caught Louie up in
his arms, and, thus burdened, tried to
run on toward the house.</p>

<p>The rest of the boys were now far
beyond them; and had just placed
their feet upon the doorstone, when a
loud shout of "help!" made them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
turn round; and there was Freddy,
with Louie in his arms, staggering up
the road, the horns of the bull within
a yard of his side!</p>

<p>Like a flash of lightning, Will
snatched up a large rake which one
of the men had left lying on the grass,
and dashed down the road. There is
one minute to spare, just one! but in
that minute Will has reached the
spot, and launching his weapon, the
iron points descend heavily on the
animal's head.</p>

<p>The bull, rather aghast at this reception,
which did not appear to be at
all to his taste, seemed to hesitate a
moment whether to charge his adversary
or not; then, with a low growl<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
of baffled fury, he slowly turned away,
and trotted off toward the wood.</p>

<p>The help had not come a minute
too soon; for Freddy, his sensitive organization
completely overwrought by
the events of the morning and his
narrow escape from death, had fallen
fainting to the ground; his hands still
clenched in the folds of little Louie's
jacket. Will instantly raised him,
when he saw that all danger was over,
and he and some of the others, who
had come crowding down the road,
very gently and quickly carried the
insensible boy to the house, and laid
him on the lounge in the library;
while Peter ran for the housekeeper
to aid in bringing him to life.</p>

<p>Good Mrs. Lockitt hurried up stairs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
as fast as she could with camphor, ice
water, and everything else she could
think of good for fainting.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Lockitt, where is papa?"
asked Peter, as he ran on beside her.</p>

<p>"Gone to New York, Master Peter,"
she replied; "I don't think he
will be home before dinner time."</p>

<p>Our little scapegrace breathed
more freely; at least there were a few
hours' safety from detection, and he
reentered the library feeling considerably
relieved.</p>

<p>There lay Colonel Freddy, his face
white as death; one little hand hanging
lax and pulseless over the side of
the lounge, and the ruffled shirt thrust
aside from the broad, snowy chest.
Harry stood over him, fanning his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
forehead; while poor Louie was
crouched in a corner, sobbing as
though his heart would break, and the
others stood looking on as if they did
not know what to do with themselves.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lockitt hastened to apply her
remedies; and soon a faint color came
back to the cheek, and with a long
sigh, the great blue eyes opened once
more, and the little patient murmured,
"Where am I?"</p>

<p>"Oh, then he's not killed, after
all!" cried Louie, running to his side.
"Dear, dear Freddy! how glad I am
you have come to life again!"</p>

<p>This funny little speech made even
Freddy laugh, and then Mrs. Lockitt
said, "But, Master Peter, you have
not told me yet how it happened<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
that Master Frederic got in such a
way."</p>

<p>The eyes of the whole party became
round and saucer-y at once; as,
all talking together, they began the
history of their fearful adventure.
Mrs. Lockitt's wiry false curls would
certainly have dropped off with astonishment
if they hadn't been sewed
fast to her cap, and she fairly wiped
her eyes on her spectacle case, which
she had taken out of her pocket instead
of her handkerchief, as they
described Freddy's noble effort to save
his helpless companion without thinking
of himself. When the narrative
was brought to a close, she could only
exclaim, "Well, Master Freddy, you
are a little angel, sure enough! and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
Master William is as brave as a lion.
To think of his stopping that great
creetur, to be sure! Wherever in the
world it came from is the mystery."
So saying, Mrs. Lockitt bustled out
of the room, and after she had gone,
there was a very serious and grateful
talk among the elder boys about the
escape they had had, and a sincere
thankfulness to God for having preserved
their lives.</p>

<p>The puzzle now was, how they
were to return to the camp, where
poor Tom had been in captivity all
this time. It was certainly necessary
to get back&mdash;but then the bull! While
they were yet deliberating on the
horns of this <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'dilemna'">dilemma</ins>, the library door<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
suddenly opened, and in walked&mdash;Mr.
Schermerhorn!</p>

<p>"Why, boys!" he exclaimed,
"how do you come to be here? Fred,
what's the matter? you look as pale as
a ghost!"</p>

<p>There was general silence for a
moment; but these boys had been
taught by pious parents to speak the
truth always, whatever came of it.
Ah! that is the right principle to go
on, dear children; <span class="smcap">Tell the Truth</span>
when you have done anything wrong,
even if you are sure of being punished
when that truth is known.</p>

<p>So George, as the eldest, with one
brave look at his comrades, frankly
related everything that had happened;
beginning at the quarrel with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
Tom, down to the escape from the
bull. To describe the varied expression
of his auditor's face between delight
and vexation, would require a
painter; and when George at last
said, "Do you think we deserve to be
punished, sir? or have we paid well
enough already for our court martial?"
Mr. Schermerhorn exclaimed,
trying to appear highly incensed, yet
scarcely able to help smiling:</p>

<p>"I declare I hardly know! I certainly
am terribly angry with you.
How dare you treat a young gentleman
so on my place? answer me that,
you scapegraces! It is pretty plain
who is at the bottom of all this&mdash;Peter
dares not look at me, I perceive.
At the same time, I am rather glad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
that Master Tom has been taught
what to expect if he runs down the
Union&mdash;it will probably save him from
turning traitor any more, though you
were not the proper persons to pass
sentence on him. As for our plucky
little Colonel here&mdash;shake hands,
Freddy! you have acted like a hero!
and for your sake I excuse the court
martial. Now, let us see what has
become of the bull, and then go to the
release of our friend Tom. He must
be thoroughly repentant for his misdeeds
by this time."</p>

<p>Mr. Schermerhorn accordingly
gave orders that the bull should be
hunted up and secured, until his master
should be discovered; so that the
Zouaves might be safe from his attacks<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
hereafter. If any of our readers
feel an interest in the fate of this
charming animal, they are informed
that he was, with great difficulty,
hunted into the stables; and before
evening taken away by his master,
the farmer from whom he had
strayed.</p>

<p>Leaving the others to await his
capture, let us return to Tom. He had
not been ten minutes in the smoke
house before his wrath began to cool,
and he would have given sixpence
for any way of getting out but by
begging pardon. That was a little too
much just yet, and Tom stamped with
rage and shook the door; which resisted
his utmost efforts to burst. Then
came the sounds without, the rushing,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
trampling steps, the furious bellow,
and the shout, "Run! run for your
lives!" Run! why on earth must
they? What had happened? and especially
what would become of him
left alone there, with this unseen enemy
perhaps coming at him next. He
hunted in vain in every direction for
some cranny to peep through; and if
it had been possible, would have
squeezed his head up the chimney.
He shouted for help, but nobody
heard him; they were all too frightened
for that. He could hear them
crunching along the road, presently;
another cry, and then all was still.</p>

<p>"What shall I do?" thought poor
Tom. "Oh, where have they gone
to? Please let me out, Freddy! do<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
forgive me, boys! I'll f-fight for the
Union as m-much as you like! oh!
oh!" and at last&mdash;must it be confessed?&mdash;the
gallant Secesh finished
by bursting out crying!</p>

<p>Time passed on&mdash;of course seeming
doubly long to the prisoner&mdash;and still
the boys did not return. Tom cried
till he could cry no more; sniffling
desperately, and rubbing his nose violently
up in the air&mdash;a proceeding
which did not ameliorate its natural
bent in that direction. He really felt
thoroughly sorry, and quite ready to
beg pardon as soon as the boys should
return; particularly as they had forgotten
to provide the captive with even the
traditional bread and water, and dinner-time
was close at hand. While he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
was yet struggling between repentance
and stomachache, the welcome sound
of their voices was heard. They came
nearer, and then a key was hastily
applied to the fastenings of the door,
and it flew open, disclosing the Zouaves,
with Freddy at the head, and
Mr. Schermerhorn bringing up the
rear.</p>

<p>Tom hung back a moment yet;
then with a sudden impulse he walked
toward Freddy, saying, "I beg your
pardon, Colonel; please forgive me for
insulting you; and as for the flag"&mdash;and
without another word, Tom ran
toward the flag staff, and catching the
long folds of the banner in both hands,
pressed them to his lips.</p>

<p>"The chivalry forever!" said Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
Schermerhorn, smiling. "That's right,
Tom! bless the old banner! it is your
safeguard, and your countrymen's too,
if they would only believe it. Go and
shake hands with him, boys; he is in
his right place now, and if ever you
are tempted to quarrel again, I am
sure North and South will both remember</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3>BEFORE MONTEREY.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is not necessary to describe the
particular proceedings of the Dashahed
Zouaves during every day of
their camp life. They chattered,
played, drilled, quarrelled a little once
in a while, and made it up again, eat
and slept considerably, and grew sunburnt
to an astonishing degree.</p>

<p>It was Thursday morning, the
fourth of their delightful days in
camp. Jerry had been teaching them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
how to handle a musket and charge
bayonets, until they were quite excited,
and rather put out that there was
no enemy to practise on but the
grasshoppers. At length, when they
had tried everything that was to be
done, Harry exclaimed, "I wish, Jerry,
you would tell us a story about
the wars! Something real splendid,
now; perfectly crammed with Indians
and scalps and awful battles and elegant
Mexican palaces full of diamonds
and gold saucepans and
lovely Spanish girls carried off by the
hair of their heads!"</p>

<p>This flourishing rigmarole, which
Harry delivered regardless of stops,
made the boys shout with laughter.</p>

<p>"You'd better tell the story yourself,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
since you know so much about
it!" said Tom.</p>

<p>"I allow you've never been in
Mexico, sir," said Jerry, grinning. "I
doubt but thar's palisses somewhar in
Mexico, but I and my mates hev been
thar, an' <i>we</i> never seed none o' 'em.
No, Master Harry, I can't tell ye sich
stories as that, but I do mind a thing
what happened on the field afore
Monterey."</p>

<p>The boys, delightedly exclaiming,
"A story! a story! hurrah!" drew
their camp stools around him; and
Jerry, after slowly rubbing his hand
round and round over his bristling
chin, while he considered what to say
first, began his story as follows:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>


<h3>JERRY'S STORY.</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It wor a Sunday night, young
genl'men, the 21st of September, and
powerful hot. We had been fightin'
like mad, wi' not a moment's rest, all
day, an' now at last wor under the
canwas, they of us as wor left alive,
a tryin' to sleep. The skeeters buzzed
aroun' wonderful thick, and the
groun' aneath our feet wor like red-hot
tin plates, wi' the sun burnin' an
blisterin' down. At last my mate Bill
says, says he, 'Jerry, my mate, hang
me ef I can stan' this any longer. Let
you an' me get up an' see ef it be
cooler out-o'-doors.'</p>

<p>"I wor tired enough wi' the day's
fight, an' worrited, too, wi' a wound<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
in my shoulder; but the tent wor no
better nor the open field, an' we got
up an' went out. Thar wor no moon,
but the sky was wonderful full o' stars,
so we could see how we wor stannin'
wi' our feet among the bodies o' the
poor fellows as had fired their last
shot that day. It wor a sight, young
genl'men, what would make sich as
you sick an' faint to look on; but
sogers must larn not to min' it; an'
we stood thar, not thinkin' how awful
it wor, and yet still an' quiet, too.</p>

<p>"'Ah, Jerry,' says Bill&mdash;he wor a
young lad, an' brought up by a pious
mother, I allow&mdash;'I dunnot like this
fightin' on the Sabba' day. The Lord
will not bless our arms, I'm afeard, if
we go agin His will so.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>"I laughed&mdash;more shame to me&mdash;an'
said, 'I'm a sight older nor you,
mate, an' I've seed a sight o' wictories
got on a Sunday. The better the day,
the better the deed, I reckon.'</p>

<p>"'Well, I don't know,' he says;
'mebbe things is allers mixed in time
o' war, an' right an' wrong change
sides a' purpose to suit them as wants
battle an' tumult to be ragin'; but it
don't go wi' my grain, noways.'</p>

<p>"I hadn't experienced a change o'
heart then, as I did arterward, bless
the Lord! an' I hardly unnerstood
what he said. While we wor a stannin'
there, all to onct too dark figgers
kim a creepin' over the field to'ard
the Major's tent. 'Look thar, Jerry,'
whispered Bill, kind o' startin' like,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
'thar's some of them rascally Mexicans.'
I looked at 'em wi'out sayin' a
wured, an' then I went back to the
tent fur my six-shooter&mdash;Bill arter me;&mdash;fur
ef it ain't the dooty o' every
Christian to extarminate them warmints
o' Mexicans, I'll be drummed
out of the army to-morrer.</p>

<p>"Wall, young genl'men&mdash;we tuck
our pistols, and slow and quiet we
moved to whar we seed the two
Greasers, as they call 'em. On they
kim, creepin' to'ard my Major's tent,
an' at las' one o' 'em raised the canwas
a bit. Bill levelled his rewolver
in a wink, an' fired. You shud ha'
seed how they tuck to their heels!
yelling all the way, till wun o' em'
dropped. The other didn't stop, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
just pulled ahead. I fired arter him
wi'out touching him; but the noise
woke the Major, an' when he hearn
wot the matter wor, he ordered the
alarm to be sounded an' the men
turned out. 'It's a 'buscade to catch
us,' he says, 'an' I'm fur being fust on
the field.'</p>

<p>"Bill an' I buckled on our cartridge
boxes, caught up our muskets,
an' were soon in the ranks. On we
marched, stiddy an' swift, to the enemy's
fortifications; an' wen we were
six hundred yards distant, kim the
command, 'Double quick.' The sky
hed clouded up all of a suddent, an'
we couldn't see well where we wor,
but thar was suthin' afore us like a
low, black wall. As we kim nearer, it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
moved kind o' cautious like, an' when
we wor within musket range, wi' a
roar like ten thousand divils, they
charged forred! Thar wor the flash
and crack o' powder, and the ring!
ping! o' the bullets, as we power'd
our shot on them an' they on us; but
not another soun'; cr-r-r-ack went the
muskets on every side agin, an' the
rascals wor driven back a minnit.
'Charge bayonets!' shouted the Major,
wen he seed that. Thar wos a
pause; a rush forred; we wor met by
the innimy half way; an' then I hearn
the awfullest o' created soun's&mdash;a man's
scream. I looked roun', an' there wos
Bill, lying on his face, struck through
an' through. Thar wos no time to
see to him then, fur the men wor fur<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
ahead o' me, an' I hed to run an' jine
the rest.</p>

<p>"We hed a sharp, quick skirmish
o' it&mdash;for ef thar is a cowardly critter
on the created airth it's a Greaser&mdash;an'
in less nor half an' hour wor beatin'
back to quarters. When all wor
quiet agin, I left my tent, an' away to
look fur Bill. I sarched an' sarched
till my heart were almost broke, an at
last I cried out, 'Oh Bill, my mate,
whar be you?' an' I hearn a fibble
v'ice say, 'Here I be, Jerry!'</p>

<p>"I swon! I wor gladder nor anything
wen I hearn that. I hugged him
to my heart, I wor moved so powerful,
an' then I tuck him on my back,
an' off to camp; werry slow an' patient,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
fur he were sore wownded, an'
the life in him wery low.</p>

<p>"Wall, young genl'men, I'll not
weary you wi' the long hours as
dragged by afore mornin'. I med him
as snug as I could, and at daybreak
we hed him took to the sugeon's
tent.</p>

<p>"I wor on guard all that mornin'
an' could not get to my lad; but at
last the relief kim roun', an' the man
as was to take my place says, says he,
'Jerry, my mate, ef I was you I'd go
right to the hosp'tl an' stay by poor
Bill' (fur they all knew as I sot gret
store by him); 'He is werry wild in his
head, I hearn, an' the sugeon says as
how he can't last long.'</p>

<p>"Ye may b'lieve how my hairt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
jumped wen I hearn that. I laid
down my gun, an' ran fur the wooden
shed, which were all the place they
hed fur them as was wownded. An'
thar wor Bill&mdash;my mate Bill&mdash;laying
on a blanket spred on the floore, wi'
his clothes all on (fur it's a hard bed,
an' his own bloody uniform, that a
sojer must die in), wi' the corpse o'
another poor fellow as had died all
alone in the night a'most touching
him, an' slopped wi' blood. I moved
it fur away all in a trimble o' sorrer,
an' kivered it decent like, so as Bill
mightn't see it an' get downhearted
fur hisself. Then I went an' sot down
aside my mate. He didn't know me,
no more nor if I wor a stranger; but
kept throwin' his arms about, an'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
moanin' out continual, 'Oh mother!
mother! Why don't you come to your
boy?'</p>

<p>"I bust right out crying, I do own,
wen I hearn that, an' takin' his han'
in mine, I tried to quiet him down a
bit; telling him it wor bad fur his
wownd to be so res'less (fur every
time he tossed, thar kim a little leap
o' blood from his breast); an' at last,
about foore o'clock in the day, he
opened his eyes quite sensible like, an'
says to me, he says, 'Dear matey, is
that you? Thank you fur coming to
see me afore I die.'</p>

<p>"'No, Bill, don't talk so,' I says,
a strivin' to be cheerful like, tho' I
seed death in his face, 'You'll be well
afore long.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Aye, well in heaven,' he says;
and then, arter a minnit, 'Jerry,' he
says, 'thar's a little bounty money as
belongs to me in my knapsack, an' my
month's wages. I want you, wen I am
gone, to take it to my mother, an' tell
her&mdash;'(he wor gaspin' fearful)&mdash;'as I
died&mdash;fightin' fur my country&mdash;an' the
flag. God bless you, Jerry&mdash;you hev
been a good frien' to me, an' I knows
as you'll do this&mdash;an' bid the boys
good-by&mdash;fur me.'</p>

<p>"I promised, wi' the tears streamin'
down my cheeks; an' then we wor
quiet a bit, fur it hurt Bill's breast to
talk, an' I could not say a wured fur
the choke in my throat. Arter a
while he says, 'Jerry, won't you sing
me the hymn as I taught you aboard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
the transport? about the Lord our
Captin?'</p>

<p>"I could hardly find v'ice to begin,
but it wor Bill's dying wish, an' I made
shift to sing as well as I could&mdash;</p>

<p>"Arter I hed sung the hymn&mdash;an'
it wor all I could do to get through&mdash;Bill
seemed to be a sight easier.
He lay still, smilin' like a child on the
mother's breast. Pretty soon arter,
the Major kim in; an' wen he seed
Bill lookin' so peaceful, he says, says
he, 'Why, cheer up, my lad! the
sugeon sayd as how you wor in a bad
way; but you look finely now;'&mdash;fur
he didn't know it wor the death look
coming over him. 'You'll be about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
soon,' says the Major, 'an' fightin' fur
the flag as brave as ever,'</p>

<p>"Bill didn't say nothing&mdash;he
seemed to be getting wild agin;&mdash;an'
looked stupid like at our Major till he
hearn the wureds about the flag. Then
he caught his breath suddint like, an',
afore we could stop him, he had
sprang to his feet&mdash;shakin' to an' fro
like a reed&mdash;but as straight as he ever
wor on parade; an', his v'ice all hoarse
an' full o' death, an' his arm in the
air, he shouted, 'Aye! God&mdash;bless&mdash;the&mdash;flag!
we'll fight fur it till&mdash;' an'
then we hearn a sort o' snap, an' he
fell forred&mdash;dead!</p>

<p>"We buried him that night, I an'
my mates. I cut off a lock o' his
hair fur his poor mother, afore we put<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
the airth over him; an' giv it to her,
wi' poor Bill's money, faithful an' true,
wen we kim home. I've lived to be
an old man since then, an' see the
Major go afore me, as I hoped to
sarve till my dyin' day; but Lord
willing I shel go next, to win the Salwation
as I've fitten for, by Bill's side,
a sojer in Christ's army, in the Etarnal
Jerusalem!"</p></div>

<p>The boys took a long breath when
Jerry had finished his story, and more
than one bright eye was filled with
tears. The rough words, and plain,
unpolished manner of the old soldier,
only heightened the impression made
by his story; and as he rose to go
away, evidently much moved by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
painful recollections it excited, there
was a hearty, "Thank you, sergeant,
for your story&mdash;it was real good!"
Jerry only touched his cap to the
young soldiers, and marched off hastily,
while the boys looked after him
in respectful silence. But young spirits
soon recover from gloomy influences,
and in a few moments they were
all chattering merrily again.</p>

<p>"What a pity we must go home
Monday!" cried Louie; "I wish we
could camp out forever! Oh, Freddy,
do write a letter to General McClellan,
and ask him to let us join the army
right away! Tell him we'll buy some
new india-rubber back-bones and
stretch ourselves out big directly, if
he'll only send right on for us!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>"Perhaps he would, if he knew
how jolly we can drill already!" said
Peter, laughing. "I tell you what,
boys, the very thing! let's have a review
before we go home. I'll ask all
the boys and girls I know to come
and look on, and we might have
quite a grand entertainment. Won't
that be splendid? We can march
about all over, and fire off the cannons
and everything! I'm sure father will
let us."</p>

<p>"Yes, but how's General McClellan
to hear anything about it?" inquired
practical Louie.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;I don't know," said Peter,
rather taken aback by this view of
the subject. "Well, somehow&mdash;never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
mind, it will be grand fun, and I mean
to ask my father right away."</p>

<p>"Take me with you?" called a
dozen fellows directly. Finally it was
concluded that it might make more
impression on Mr. Schermerhorn's
mind, if the application came from
the regiment in a body; so, running
for their swords and guns, officers and
men found their places in the battalion,
and the grand procession started
on its way&mdash;chattering all the time, in
utter defiance of that "article of war"
which forbids "talking in the ranks."
Just as they were passing the lake,
they heard carriage wheels crunching
on the gravel, and drew up in a long
line on the other side of the road to
let the vehicle pass them; much to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
the astonishment of two pretty young
ladies and a sweet little girl, about
Freddy's age, who were leaning comfortably
back in the handsome barouche.</p>

<p>"Why, Peter!" exclaimed one of
the ladies, "what in the world is all
this?"</p>

<p>"This!" cried Peter, running up to
the carriage, "why, these are the
Dashahed Zouaves, Miss Carlton.
We have been in camp ever since
Monday. Good morning, Miss Jessie,"
to the little girl on the front seat, who
was looking on with deep interest.</p>

<p>"Oh, to be sure, I remember," said
Miss Carlton, laughing; "come, introduce
the Zouaves, Peter; we are
wild to know them!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>The boys clustered eagerly about
the carriage and a lively chat took
place. The Zouaves, some blushing and
bashful, others frank and confident,
and all desperately in love already with
pretty little Jessie, related in high glee
their adventures&mdash;except the celebrated
court martial&mdash;and enlarged
glowingly upon the all-important subject
of the grand review.</p>

<p>Colonel Freddy, of course, played
a prominent part in all this, and with
his handsome face, bright eyes, and
frank, gentlemanly ways, needed only
those poor lost curls to be a perfect
picture of a soldier. He chattered
away with Miss Lucy, the second sister,
and obtained her special promise
that she would plead their cause with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
Mr. Schermerhorn in case the united
petitions of the corps should fail. The
young ladies did not know of Mrs.
Schermerhorn's departure, but Freddy
and Peter together coaxed them to
come up to the house "anyhow." The
carriage was accordingly taken into
the procession, and followed it meekly
to the house; the Zouaves insisting on
being escort, much to the terror of
the young ladies; who were in constant
apprehension that the rear rank
and the horses might come to kicks&mdash;not
to say blows&mdash;and the embarrassment
of the coachman; who, as they
were constantly stopping unexpectedly
to turn round and talk, didn't know
"where to have them," as the saying
is. However, they reached their destination<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
in safety before long, and
found Mr. Schermerhorn seated on the
piazza. He hastened forward to meet
them, with the cordial greeting of an
old friend.</p>

<p>"Well, old bachelor," said Miss
Carlton, gayly, as the young ladies ascended
the steps, "you see we have
come to visit you in state, with the
military escort befitting patriotic
young ladies who have four brothers
on the Potomac. What has become
of Madame, please?"</p>

<p>"Gone to Niagara and left me a
'lone lorn creetur;'" said Mr. Schermerhorn,
laughing. "Basely deserted
me when my farming couldn't be left.
But how am I to account for the presence
of the military, mademoiselle?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>"Really, I beg their pardons," exclaimed
Miss Carlton. "They have
come on a special deputation to you,
Mr. Schermerhorn, so pray don't let
us interrupt business."</p>

<p>Thus apostrophised, the boys
scampered eagerly up the steps; and
Freddy, a little bashful, but looking
as bright as a button, delivered the
following brief oration: "Mr. Schermerhorn:
I want&mdash;that is, the boys
want&mdash;I mean we all want&mdash;to have a
grand review on Saturday, and ask
our friends to look on. Will you let
us do it, please?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, with the greatest
pleasure!" replied Mr. Schermerhorn,
smiling; "but what will become of
you good people when I tell you that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
I have just received a letter from Mrs.
Schermerhorn, asking me to join her
this week instead of next, and bring
Peter with me."</p>

<p>"Oh! father, please let me stay!"
interrupted Peter; "can't you tell
ma I've joined the army for the war?
We all want to stay like everything!"</p>

<p>"And forage for yourselves?" said
his father, laughing. "No, the army
must give you up, and lose a valuable
member, Master Peter; but just have
the goodness to listen a moment. The
review shall take place, but as the
camp will have to break up on Saturday
instead of Monday, as I had intended,
the performances must come
off to-morrow. Does that suit your
ideas?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>The boys gave a delighted consent
to this arrangement, and now the only
thing which dampened their enjoyment
was the prospect of such a
speedy end being put to their camp
life. "Confound it! what was the fun
for a fellow to be poked into a stupid
watering place, where he must bother
to keep his hair parted down the middle,
and a clean collar stiff enough to
choke him on from morning till
night?" as Tom indignantly remarked
to George and Will the same evening.
"The fact is, this sort of thing is <i>the</i>
thing for a <i>man</i> after all!" an opinion
in which the other <i>men</i> fully concurred.</p>

<p>But let us return to the piazza,
where we have left the party. After<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
a few moments more spent in chatting
with Mr. Schermerhorn, it was decided
to accept Colonel Freddy's polite
invitation, which he gave with such a
bright little bow, to inspect the camp.
You may be sure it was in apple-pie
order, for Jerry, who had taken the
Zouaves under his special charge, insisted
on their keeping it in such a
state of neatness as only a soldier ever
achieved. The party made an extremely
picturesque group&mdash;the gay
uniforms of the Zouaves, and light
summer dresses of the ladies, charmingly
relieved against the background
of trees; while Mr. Schermerhorn's
stately six feet, and somewhat portly
proportions, quite reminded one of
General Scott; especially among such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
a small army; in which George alone
quite came up to the regulation "63
inches."</p>

<p>Little Jessie ran hither and thither,
surrounded by a crowd of adorers,
who would have given their
brightest buttons, every "man" of
them, to be the most entertaining fellow
of the corps. They showed her
the battery and the stacks of shining
guns&mdash;made to stand up by Jerry in a
wonderful fashion that the boys never
could hope to attain&mdash;the inside of all
the tents, and the smoke guard house
(Tom couldn't help a blush as he
looked in); and finally, as a parting
compliment (which, let me tell you, is
the greatest, in a boy's estimation,
that can possibly be paid), Freddy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
made her a present of his very largest
and most gorgeous "glass agates;"
one of which was all the colors of the
rainbow, and the other patriotically
adorned with the Stars and Stripes in
enamel. Peter climbed to the top of
the tallest cherry tree, and brought
her down a bough at least a yard and
a half long, crammed with "ox
hearts;" Harry eagerly offered to
make any number of "stunning baskets"
out of the stones, and in short
there never was such a belle seen before.</p>

<p>"Oh, a'int she jolly!" was the ruling
opinion among the Zouaves. A
private remark was also circulated to
the effect that "Miss Jessie was stunningly
pretty."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>The young ladies at last said good-by
to the camp; promising faithfully
to send all the visitors they could to
the grand review, and drove off highly
entertained with their visit. Mr.
Schermerhorn decided to take the afternoon
boat for the city and return
early Friday morning, and the boys,
left to themselves, began to think of
dinner, as it was two o'clock. A brisk
discussion was kept up all dinner time
you may be sure, concerning the
event to come off on the morrow.</p>

<p>"I should like to know, for my
part, what we do in a review," said
Jimmy, balancing his fork <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'arttisically'">artistically</ins>
on the end of his finger, and looking
solemnly round the table.</p>

<p>"Why, show off everything we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
know!" said Charley Spicer. "March
about, and form into ranks and columns,
and all that first, then do
charming "parade rest," "'der
humps!" and the rest of it; and finish
off by firing off our guns, and
showing how we can't hit anything by
any possibility!"</p>

<p>"But these guns won't fire off!"
objected Jimmy.</p>

<p>"Well, the cannon then!"</p>

<p>"But I'm sure father won't let us
have any powder," said Peter disconsolately.
"You can't think how I
burnt the end of my nose last Fourth
with powder! It was so sore I
couldn't blow it for a week!"</p>

<p>The boys all burst out laughing at
this dreadful disaster, and George<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
said, "You weren't lighting it with
the end of your nose, were you?"</p>

<p>"No; but I was stooping over,
charging one of my cannon, and I
dropped the 'punk' right in the muzzle
somehow, and, would you believe
it, the nasty thing went off and burnt
my nose! and father said I shouldn't
play with powder any more, because
I might have put out my eyes."</p>

<p>"Well, we must take it out in
marching, then," said Freddy, with a
tremendous sigh.</p>

<p>"No, hold on; I'll tell you what
we can do!" cried Tom, eagerly. "I
have some 'double headers' left from
the Fourth; we might fire them out
of the cannon; they make noise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
enough, I'm sure. I'll write to my
mother this afternoon and get them."</p>

<p>The boys couldn't help being struck
with the generosity of this offer, coming
from Tom after their late rather
unkind treatment of him; and the
older ones especially were very particular
to thank him for his present.
As soon as dinner was over, he started
for the house to ask Mr. Schermerhorn
to carry his message. As he
hurried along the road, his bright
black eyes sparkling with the happiness
of doing a good action, he heard
trotting steps behind him, felt an arm
stealing round his neck, schoolboy
fashion, and there was Freddy.</p>

<p>"I ran after you all the way," he
pantingly said. "I want to tell you,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
dear Tom, how much we are obliged
to you for giving us your crackers,
and how sorry we are that we acted
so rudely to you the other day. Please
forgive us; we all like you so much,
and we would feel as mean as anything
to take your present without begging
pardon. George, Peter, and I feel
truly ashamed of ourselves every time
we think of that abominable court
martial."</p>

<p>"There, old fellow, don't say a
word more about it!" was the hearty
response; and Tom threw his arm
affectionately about his companion.
"It was my fault, Freddy, and all because
I was mad at poor old Jerry;
how silly! I was sorry for what I
said right afterward."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then we are friends again?"
cried Freddy, joyfully.</p>

<p>"Yes; I'll like you as long as I
live! and ever so much longer." And
so we will leave the two on their walk
to the house, and close this abominably
long chapter.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3>A GRAND REVIEW.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are really scarcely words
enough in the dictionary properly to
describe the immense amount of drill
got through with by the Dashahed
Zouaves between three o'clock that
afternoon and twelve, noon, of the following
day. This Friday afternoon
was going to be memorable in history
for one of the most splendid reviews
on record. They almost ran poor old
Jerry off his legs in their eagerness to
go over every possible variety of exercise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
known to "Hardee's Tactics," and
nearly dislocated their shoulder blades
trying to waggle their elbows backward
and forward all at once when
they went at "double quick;" at the
same time keeping the other arm immovably
pinioned to their sides. Then
that wonderful operation of stacking
the rebellious guns, which obstinately
clattered down nine times and a half
out of ten, had to be gone through
with, and a special understanding promulgated
in the corps as to when Jerry's
"'der arms!" meant "shoulder
arms," and when "order arms" (or
bringing all the muskets down together
with a bang); and, in short,
there never was such a busy time seen
in camp before.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>Friday morning dawned, if possible,
still more splendidly than any of
the preceding days, with a cool, refreshing
breeze, just enough snowy
clouds in the sky to keep off the fiery
summer heat in a measure, and not a
headache nor a heartache among the
Zouaves to mar the pleasure of the
day. The review was to come off at
four o'clock, when the July sun would
be somewhat diminished in warmth,
and from some hints that Jerry let
fall, Mrs. Lockitt, and the fat cook,
Mrs. Mincemeat, were holding high
council up at the house, over a certain
collation to be partaken of at the end
of the entertainments.</p>

<p>As the day wore on the excitement
of our friends the Zouaves increased.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
They could hardly either eat their
dinners, or sit down for more than a
moment at a time; and when, about
three o'clock, Mr. Schermerhorn entered
the busy little camp, he was surrounded
directly with a crowd of
eager questioners, all talking at once,
and making as much noise as a colony
of rooks.</p>

<p>"Patience, patience, my good
friends!" laughed Mr. Schermerhorn,
holding up a finger for silence.
"Every one in turn. Tom, here are
your 'double headers,' with love from
your mother. Fred, I saw your father
to-day, and they are all coming down
to the review. George, here is a note
left for you in my box at the Post
Office, and Dashahed Zouaves in general&mdash;I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
have one piece of advice to
give you. Get dressed quietly, and
then sit down and rest yourselves.
You will be tired out by the end of the
afternoon, at all events; so don't frisk
about more than you can help at present;"
and Mr. Schermerhorn left the
camp; while the boys, under strong
pressure of Jerry, and the distant notes
of a band which suddenly began to
make itself heard, dressed themselves
as nicely as they could, and sat down
with heroic determination to wait for
four o'clock.</p>

<p>Presently, carriages began to
crunch over the gravel road one after
another, filled with merry children,
and not a few grown people besides.
Mr. and Mrs. Jourdain, with Bella,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
were among the first to arrive; and
soon after the Carltons' barouche
drove up. Jessie, for some unknown
reason, was full of half nervous glee,
and broke into innumerable little trilling
laughs when any one spoke to
her. A sheet of lilac note paper, folded
up tight, which she held in her
hand, seemed to have something to do
with it, and her soft brown curls and
spreading muslin skirts were in equal
danger of irremediable "mussing," as
she fidgetted about on the carriage
seat, fully as restless as any of the
Zouaves.</p>

<p>Mr. Schermerhorn received his
guests on the piazza, where all the
chairs in the house, one would think,
were placed for the company, as the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
best view of the lawn was from this
point. To the extreme right were the
white tents of the camp, half hidden
by the immense trunk of a magnificent
elm, the only tree that broke the
smooth expanse of the lawn. On the
left a thick hawthorne hedge separated
the ornamental grounds from the
cultivated fields of the place, while in
front the view was bounded by the
blue and sparkling waters of the
Sound.</p>

<p>Soon four o'clock struck; and,
punctual to the moment, the Zouaves
could be seen in the distance, forming
their ranks. Jerry, in his newest suit
of regimentals, bustled about here and
there, and presently his voice was
heard shouting, "Are ye all ready<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
now? <span class="smcap">Squad, 'Shun!</span> HARCH!" and to
the melodious notes of "Dixie," performed
by the band, which was stationed
nearer the house, the regiment
started up the lawn! Jerry marching
up beside them, and occasionally uttering
such mysterious mandates as,
"Easy in the centre! keep your fours
in the wheel! <i>Steady</i> now!"</p>

<p>Oh, what a burst of delighted applause
greeted them as they neared
the house! The boys hurrahed, the
girls clapped their hands, ladies and
gentlemen waved their hats and handkerchiefs;
while the Dashahed Zouaves,
too soldierly <i>now</i> to grin, drew
up in a long line, and stood like statues,
without so much as winking.</p>

<p>And now the music died away, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
everybody was as still as a mouse, while
Jerry advanced to the front, and issued
the preliminary order:</p>

<p>"To the rear&mdash;open order!" and the
rear rank straightway fell back; executing,
in fact, that wonderful "tekkinapesstoth'rare"
which had puzzled
them so much on the first day of their
drilling. Then came those other wonderful
orders:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"P'<i>sent</i> humps!<br />
"<i>Der</i> humps!<br />
"Gr'<i>nd</i> humps!"<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>And so on, at which the muskets flew
backward and forward, up and down,
with such wonderful precision. The
spectators were delighted beyond
measure; an enthusiastic young gentleman,
with about three hairs on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
each side of his mustache, who belonged
to the Twenty-second Regiment,
declared "It was the best drill
he had seen out of his company
room!" a celebrated artist, whose
name I dare not tell for the world,
sharpened his pencil, and broke the
point off three times in his hurry, and
at last produced the beautiful sketch
which appears at the front of this volume;
while all the little boys who
were looking on, felt as if they would
give every one of their new boots and
glass agates to belong to the gallant
Dashahed Zouaves.</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i002.jpg" width="600" height="429" alt="&quot;DOUBLE-QUICK.&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;DOUBLE-QUICK.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>After the guns had been put in
every possible variety of position, the
regiment went through their marching.
They broke into companies,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
formed the line again, divided in two
equal parts, called "breaking into platoons,"
showed how to "wheel on the
right flank," and all manner of other
mysteries.</p>

<p>Finally, they returned to their
companies, and on Jerry's giving the
order, they started at "double quick"
(which is the most comical tritty-trot
movement you can think of), dashed
down the slope of the lawn, round the
great elm, up hill again full speed, and
in a moment more were drawn up in
unbroken lines before the house, and
standing once again like so many
statues.</p>

<p>It was really splendid! Round after
round of applause greeted the
Zouaves, who kept their positions for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
a moment, then snatching off their
saucy little fez caps, they gave the
company three cheers in return, of the
most tremendous description; which
quite took away the little remaining
breath they had after the "double
quick."</p>

<p>Thus ended the first part of the review;
and now, with the assistance of
their rather Lilliputian battery, and
Tom's double headers, they went
through some firing quite loud enough
to make the little girls start and jump
uncomfortably; so this part of the entertainment
was brought to rather a
sudden conclusion. Jerry had just issued
the order, "Close up in ranks to
dismiss," when Mr. Schermerhorn,
who, with Miss Carlton and Jessie,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
had left the piazza a few minutes before,
came forward, saying, "Have the
goodness to wait a moment, Colonel;
there is one more ceremony to go
through with."</p>

<p>The boys looked at each other in
silent curiosity, wondering what could
be coming; when, all at once, the
chairs on the piazza huddled back in
a great hurry, to make a lane for a
beautiful little figure, which came
tripping from the open door.</p>

<p>It was Jessie; but a great change
had been made in her appearance.
Over her snowy muslin skirts she had
a short classic tunic of red, white, and
blue silk; a wreath of red and white
roses and bright blue jonquils encircled
her curls, and in her hand she carried<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
a superb banner. It was made of dark
blue silk, trimmed with gold fringe;
on one side was painted an American
eagle, and on the other the words
"Dashahed Zouaves," surrounded
with a blaze of glory and gold stars.
She advanced to the edge of the piazza,
and in a clear, sweet voice, a little
tremulous, but very distinct, she
said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">"<span class="smcap">Colonel and Brave Soldiers</span>:

<p>"I congratulate you, in the name
of our friends, on the success you have
achieved. You have shown us to-day
what Young America can do; and as
a testimonial of our high admiration,
I present you the colors of your regiment!</p>

<p>"Take them, as the assurance that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
our hearts are with you; bear them
as the symbol of the Cause you have
enlisted under; and should you fall
beneath them on the field of battle, I
bid you lay down your lives cheerfully
for the flag of your country, and
breathe with your last sigh the name
of the Union! Colonel, take your
colors!"</p></div>

<p>Freddy's cheeks grew crimson, and
the great tears swelled to his eyes as
he advanced to take the flag which
Jessie held toward him. And now
our little Colonel came out bright,
sure enough. Perhaps not another
member of the regiment, called upon
to make a speech in this way, could
have thought of a word to reply; but
Freddy's quick wit supplied him with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
the right ideas; and it was with a
proud, happy face, and clear voice
that he responded:</p>

<div class="blockquot">"<span class="smcap">Ladies and Gentlemen</span>:

<p>"I thank you, in the name of my
regiment, for the honor you have done
us. Inspired by your praises, proud to
belong to the army of the Republic,
we hope to go on as we have begun.
To your kindness we owe the distinguishing
colors under which we march
hereafter; and by the Union for which
we fight, they shall never float over a
retreating battalion!"</p></div>

<p>Oh! the cheers and clapping of
hands which followed this little
speech! Everybody was looking at
Freddy as he stood there, the colors in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
his hand, and the bright flush on his
cheek, with the greatest admiration.
Of course, his parents weren't proud
of him; certainly not!</p>

<p>But the wonders were not at an
end yet; for suddenly the band began
playing a new air, and to this accompaniment,
the sweet voice of some
lady unseen, but which sounded to
those who knew, wonderfully like Miss
Lucy Carlton's, sang the following patriotic
ballad:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"We will stand by our Flag&mdash;let it lead where it will&mdash;<br />
Our hearts and our hopes fondly cling to it still;<br />
Through battle and danger our Cause must be won&mdash;<br />
Yet forward! undaunted we'll follow it on!<br />
'Tis the Flag! the old Flag! still unsullied and bright,<br />
As when first its fair stars lit oppression's dark night<br />
And the standard that guides us forever shall be<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>The Star-spangled Banner, the Flag of the Free!<br />
<br />
"A handful of living&mdash;an army of dead,<br />
The last charge been made and the last prayer been said;<br />
What is it&mdash;as sad we retreat from the plain<br />
That cheers us, and nerves us to rally again?<br />
'Tis the Flag! the old Flag! to our country God-given,<br />
That gleams through our ranks like a glory from heaven!<br />
And the foe, as they fly, in our vanguard shall see<br />
The Star-spangled Banner, the Flag of the Free!<br />
<br />
"We will fight for the Flag, by the love that we bear<br />
In the Union and Freedom, we'll baffle despair;<br />
Trust on in our country, strike home for the right,<br />
And Treason shall vanish like mists of the night.<br />
Then cheer the old Flag! every star in it glows,<br />
The terror of traitors! the curse of our foes!<br />
And the victory that crowns us shall glorified be,<br />
'Neath the Star-spangled Banner, the Flag of the Free!"<br />
</div>

<p>As the song ended, there was another
tumult of applause; and then
the band struck up a lively quickstep,
and the company, with the Zouaves<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
marching ahead, poured out on the
lawn toward the camp, where a bountiful
collation was awaiting them,
spread on the regimental table. Two
splendid pyramids of flowers ornamented
the centre, and all manner of
"goodies," as the children call them,
occupied every inch of space on the
sides. At the head of the table Jerry
had contrived a canopy from a large
flag, and underneath this, Miss Jessie,
Colonel Freddy, with the other
officers, and some favored young ladies
of their own age, took their seats.
The other children found places around
the table, and a merrier f&eacute;te champ&ecirc;tre
never was seen. The band continued
to play lively airs from time to
time, and I really can give you my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
word as an author, that nobody looked
cross for a single minute!</p>

<p>Between you and me, little reader,
there had been a secret arrangement
among the grown folks interested in
the regiment, to get all this up in such
fine style. Every one had contributed
something to give the Zouaves their
flag and music, while to Mr. Schermerhorn
it fell to supply the supper;
and arrangements had been made and
invitations issued since the beginning
of the week. The regiment, certainly,
had the credit, however, of getting up
the review, it only having been the idea
of their good friends to have the entertainment
and flag presentation. So
there was a pleasant surprise on both
sides; and each party in the transaction,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
was quite as much astonished and
delighted as the other could wish.</p>

<p>The long sunset shadows were rapidly
stealing over the velvet sward as
the company rose from table, adding
a new charm to the beauty of the
scene. Everywhere the grass was
dotted with groups of elegant ladies
and gentlemen, and merry children, in
light summer dresses and quaintly
pretty uniforms. The little camp, with
the stacks of guns down its centre, the
bayonets flashing in the last rays of
the sun, was all crowded and brilliant
with happy people; looking into the
tents and admiring their exquisite order,
inspecting the bright muskets,
and listening eagerly or good-humoredly,
as they happened to be children<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
or grown people, to the explanations
and comments of the Zouaves.</p>

<p>And on the little grassy knoll,
where the flag staff was planted, central
figure of the scene, stood Colonel
Freddy, silent and thoughtful for the
first time to-day, with Jerry beside
him. The old man had scarcely left
his side since the boy took the flag;
he would permit no one else to wait
upon him at table, and his eyes followed
him as he moved among the gay
crowd, with a glance of the utmost
pride and affection. The old volunteer
seemed to feel that the heart of a
soldier beat beneath the little dandy
ruffled shirt and gold-laced jacket of
the young Colonel. Suddenly, the boy
snatches up again the regimental colors;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
the Stars and Stripes, and little
Jessie's flag, and shakes them out to
the evening breeze; and as they flash
into view and once more the cheers
of the Zouaves greet their colors, he
says, with quivering lip and flashing
eye, "Jerry, if God spares me to be a
man, I'll live and die a soldier!"</p>

<p>The soft evening light was deepening
into night, and the beautiful planet
Venus rising in the west, when the
visitors bade adieu to the camp; the
Zouaves were shaken hands with until
their wrists fairly ached; and then
they all shook hands with "dear"
Jessie, as Charley was heard to call
her before the end of the day, and
heard her say in her soft little voice
how sorry she was they must go to-morrow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
(though she certainly couldn't
have been sorrier than <i>they</i> were), and
then the good people all got into their
carriages again, and drove off; waving
their handkerchiefs for good-by
as long as the camp could be seen;
and so, with the sound of the last
wheels dying away in the distance,
ended the very end of</p>

<div class='center'>
<span class="smcap">The Grand Review</span>.<br />
</div>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER V.&mdash;<span class="smcap">and last</span>.</h2>

<h3>"HOME, SWEET HOME."</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">And</span> now, at last, had come that
"day of disaster," when Camp McClellan
must be deserted. The very sun
didn't shine so brilliantly as usual,
thought the Zouaves; and it was positively
certain that the past five days,
although they had occurred in the
middle of summer, were the very
shortest ever known! Eleven o'clock
was the hour appointed for the breaking
up of the camp, in order that they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
might return to the city by the early
afternoon boat.</p>

<p>"Is it possible we have been here
a week?" exclaimed Jimmy, as he sat
down to breakfast. "It seems as if
we had only come yesterday."</p>

<p>"What a jolly time it has been!"
chimed in Charley Spicer. "I don't
want to go to Newport a bit. Where
are you going, Tom?"</p>

<p>"To Baltimore&mdash;but I don't mean
to Secesh!" added Tom, with a little
blush. "I have a cousin in the Palmetto
Guards at Charleston, and that's
one too many rebels in the family."</p>

<p>"Never mind!" cried George
Chadwick; "the Pringles are a first
rate family; the rest of you are loyal
enough, I'm sure!" and George gave<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
Tom such a slap on the back, in token
of his good will, that it quite brought
the tears into his eyes.</p>

<p>When breakfast was over, the
Zouaves repaired to their tents, and
proceeded to pack their clothes
away out of the lockers. They were
not very scientific packers, and, in
fact, the usual mode of doing the
business was to ram everything higgledy-piggledy
into their valises, and
then jump on them until they consented
to come together and be
locked. Presently Jerry came trotting
down with a donkey cart used on
the farm, and under his directions the
boys folded their blankets neatly up,
and placed them in the vehicle, which
then drove off with its load, leaving<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
them to get out and pile together the
other furnishings of the tents; for, of
course, as soldiers, they were expected
to wind up their own affairs, and we
all know that boys will do considerable
<i>hard work</i> when it comes in the
form of <i>play</i>. Just as the cart, with
its vicious little wrong-headed steed,
had tugged, and jerked, and worried
itself out of sight, a light basket carriage,
drawn by two dashing black
Canadian ponies, drew up opposite the
camp, and the reins were let fall by a
young lady in a saucy "pork pie"
straw hat, who was driving&mdash;no other
than Miss Carlton, with Jessie beside
her. The boys eagerly surrounded the
little carriage, and Miss Carlton said,
laughing, "Jessie begged so hard for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
a last look at the camp, that I had to
bring her. So you are really going
away?"</p>

<p>"Really," repeated Freddy; "but
I am so glad you came, Miss Jessie,
just in time to see us off."</p>

<p>"You know soldiers take themselves
away houses and all," said
George; "you will see the tents come
down with a run presently."</p>

<p>"And here comes Jerry to help
us!" added Harry. As he spoke, the
donkey cart rattled up, and Jerry,
touching his cap to the ladies, got out,
and prepared to superintend the downfall
of the tents. By his directions,
two of the Zouaves went to each tent,
and pulled the stakes first from one
corner, then the other; then they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
grasped firmly the pole which supported
the centre, and when the sergeant
ejaculated "Now!" like a flash!
the tents slid smoothly to the ground
all at the same moment, just as you
may have made a row of blocks fall
down by upsetting the first one.</p>

<p>And now came the last ceremony,
the hauling down of the flag.</p>

<p>"Stand by to fire a salute!" shouted
Jerry, and instantly a company
was detached, who brought the six
little cannon under the flagstaff, and
charged them with the last of the
double headers, saved for this purpose;
Freddy stood close to the flagstaff,
with the halyards ready in his
hands. Crack! fizz! went six matches<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
for the cannon. "Make ready! apply
light, FIRE!"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bang!</span> and the folds of the flag
stream out proudly in the breeze, as it
rapidly descends the halyards, and
flutters softly to the greensward.</p>

<p>There was perfectly dead silence
for a moment; then the voice of Mr.
Schermerhorn was heard calling,
"Come, boys, are you ready? Jump
in, then, it is time to start for the
boat." The boys turned and saw the
carriages which had brought them so
merrily to the camp waiting to convey
them once more to the wharf;
while a man belonging to the farm
was rapidly piling the regimental luggage
into a wagon.</p>

<p>With sorrowful faces the Zouaves<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
clustered around the pretty pony
chaise; shaking hands once more with
Jessie, and internally vowing to adore
her as long as they lived. Then they
got into the carriages, and old Jerry
grasped Freddy's hand with an affectionate
"Good-by, my little Colonel,
God bless ye! Old Jerry won't never
forget your noble face as long as he
lives." It would have seemed like insulting
the old man to offer him money
in return for his loving admiration,
but the handsome gilt-edged Bible
that found its way to him soon after
the departure of the regiment, was inscribed
with the irregular schoolboy
signature of "Freddy Jourdain, with
love to his old friend Jeremiah Pike."</p>

<p>As for the regimental standards,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
they were found to be rather beyond the
capacity of a rockaway crammed full
of Zouaves, so Tom insisted on riding
on top of the baggage, that he might
have the pleasure of carrying them all
the way. Up he mounted, as brisk as
a lamplighter, with that monkey, Peter,
after him, the flags were handed
up, and with three ringing cheers, the
vehicles started at a rapid trot, and
the regiment was fairly off. They almost
broke their necks leaning back
to see the last of "dear Jessie," until
the locusts hid them from sight, when
they relapsed into somewhat dismal
silence for full five minutes.</p>

<p>As Peter was going on to Niagara
with his father, Mr. Schermerhorn accompanied
the regiment to the city,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
which looked dustier and red brickier
(what a word!) than ever, now that
they were fresh from the lovely green
of the country. By Mr. Schermerhorn's
advice, the party took possession
of two empty Fifth avenue stages
which happened to be waiting at the
Fulton ferry, and rode slowly up
Broadway to Chambers street, where
Peter and his father bid them good-by,
and went off to the d&eacute;p&ocirc;t. As Peter
had declined changing his clothes
before he left, they had to travel all
the way to Buffalo with our young
friend in this unusual guise; but, as
people had become used to seeing soldiers
parading about in uniform, they
didn't seem particularly surprised,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
whereat Master Peter was rather disappointed.</p>

<p>To go back to the Zouaves, however.
When the stages turned into
Fifth avenue, they decided to get out;
and after forming their ranks in fine
style, they marched up the avenue, on
the sidewalk this time, stopping at the
various houses or street corners where
they must bid adieu to one and another
of their number, promising to see
each other again as soon as possible.</p>

<p>At last only Tom and Freddy were
left to go home by themselves. As
they marched along, keeping faultless
step, Freddy exclaimed, "I tell
you what, Tom! I mean to ask my
father, the minute he comes home, to
let me go to West Point as soon as I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
leave school! I must be a soldier&mdash;I
can't think of anything else!"</p>

<p>"That's just what I mean to do!"
cried Tom, with sparkling eyes; "and,
Fred, if you get promoted before me,
promise you will have me in your
regiment, won't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes I will, certainly!" answered
Freddy; "but you're the oldest, Tom,
and, you know, the oldest gets promoted
first; so mind you don't forget
me when you come to your command!"</p>

<p>As he spoke, they reached his own
home; and our hero, glad after all to
come back to father, mother, and sister,
bounded up the steps, and rang
the bell good and <i>hard</i>, just to let Joseph
know that a personage of eminence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
had arrived. As the door
opened, he turned gayly round, cap in
hand, saying, "Good-by, Maryland;
you've left the regiment, but you'll
never leave the Union!" and the last
words he heard Tom say were, "No,
by George, <i>never!</i>"</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>And now, dear little readers, my
boy friends in particular, the history
of Freddy Jourdain must close. He
still lives in New York, and attends
Dr. Larned's school, where he is at the
head of all his classes.</p>

<p>The Dashahed Zouaves have met
very often since the encampment, and
had many a good drill in their room&mdash;the
large attic floor which Mr.
Jourdain allowed them for their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
special accommodation, and where
the beautiful regimental colors are
carefully kept, to be proudly displayed
in every parade of the Zouaves.</p>

<p>When he is sixteen, the boy Colonel
is to enter West Point Academy,
and learn to be a real soldier; while
Tom&mdash;poor Tom, who went down to
Baltimore that pleasant July month,
promising so faithfully to join Freddy
in the cadet corps, may never see the
North again.</p>

<p>And in conclusion let me say, that
should our country again be in danger
in after years, which God forbid, we
may be sure that first in the field, and
foremost in the van of the grand
army, will be our gallant young
friend,</p>

<h2>CONCLUSION.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> took a great many Saturday afternoons
to finish the story of "Colonel
Freddy," and the children returned
to it at each reading with renewed
and breathless interest. George and
Helen couldn't help jumping up off
their seats once or twice and clapping
their hands with delight when anything
specially exciting took place in
the pages of the wonderful story that
was seen "before it was printed," and
a great many "oh's" and "ah's" testified
to their appreciation of the gallant
"Dashahed Zouaves." They
laughed over the captive Tom, and
cried over the true story of the old
sergeant; and when at length the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
very last word had been read, and
their mother had laid down the manuscript,
George sprang up once more,
exclaiming; "Oh, I wish I could be a
boy soldier! Mamma, mayn't I recruit
a regiment and camp out too?"
"And oh! if I could only present a
flag!" cried his sister; "I wish I had
been Jessie; what a pity it wasn't all
true!"</p>

<p>"And what if I should tell you,"
said their mother, laughing, "that a
little bird has whispered in my ear
that 'Colonel Freddy' was wonderfully
like your little Long Island friend
Hilton R&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Oh, mamma! why, what makes
you think so?"</p>

<p>"Oh, something funny I heard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
about him last summer; never mind
what!"</p>

<p>The children wisely concluded that
it was no use to ask any more questions;
at the same moment solemnly resolving
that the very next time they paid
a visit to their aunt, who lived at Astoria,
they would beg her to let them
drive over to Mr. R&mdash;&mdash;'s place, and
find out all about it.</p>

<p>After this, there were no more
readings for several Saturdays; but at
last one morning when the children
had almost given up all hopes of more
stories, George opened his eyes on the
sock hanging against the door, which
looked more bulgy than ever. "Hurrah!"
he shouted; "Aunt Fanny's
daughter hasn't forgotten us, after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
all!" and dressing himself in a double
quick, helter-skelter fashion, George
dashed out into the entry, forgot his
good resolution, and slid down the
banisters like a streak of lightning
and began pummelling on his sister's
door with both fists; shouting, "Come,
get up! get up, Nelly! here's another
Sock story for us!"</p>

<p>This delightful announcement was
quite sufficient to make Helen's stockings,
which she was just drawing on in
a lazy fashion, fly up to their places in
a hurry; then she popped her button-over
boots on the wrong feet, and had
to take them off and try again; and,
in short, the whole of her dressing was
an excellent illustration of that time-honored
maxim, "The more <i>haste</i>, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
worse <i>speed;</i>" George, meanwhile, performing
a distracted Indian war dance
in the entry outside, until his father
opened his door and wanted to know
what the racket was all about.</p>

<p>"Socks! socks! father!" cried
George, joyfully.</p>

<p>At this moment Helen came out,
and the two children scampered down
stairs, and sitting down side by side on
the sofa, they proceeded to examine
this second instalment of the Sock
stories. They found it was again a
whole book; and the title, on a little
page by itself, read "<span class="smcap">German Socks</span>."</p>

<p>"Oh, I am so glad!" said Helen.
"These must be more stories like that
dear 'Little White Angel.'"</p>

<p>And so they proved to be; for, on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
their mother's commencing to read
the first story, it was found to be
called, "God's Pensioners;" and commenced,
"It was a cold&mdash;" but stop!
halt! This book was to be devoted
to "Colonel Freddy;" but if you will
only go to Mr. Leavitt's, the publishers,
you will there discover what
was the rest of the second Sock Stories.</p>
